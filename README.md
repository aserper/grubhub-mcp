# Grubhub MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides programmatic access to Grubhub's food delivery platform. Search restaurants, browse menus, manage your cart, place orders, and track deliveries — all through MCP tools.

## Features

- **Search & Discovery** — Find restaurants by location, cuisine, or keyword with autocomplete
- **Restaurant & Menus** — View restaurant details, full menus, item options and pricing
- **Cart Management** — Create carts, add/remove items, apply promo codes, set tips
- **Order Flow** — Place orders, track deliveries in real-time, reorder past meals
- **Account Management** — Manage profile, saved addresses, favorites, and passwords
- **Payments** — View saved payment methods, check gift card balances

## Installation

### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add aserper/grubhub-mcp
claude plugin install grubhub-mcp@grubhub-marketplace
```

### uvx (No Installation Required)

Add to your Claude Code MCP settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grubhub": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "grubhub-mcp", "grubhub"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual / From Source

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aserper/grubhub-mcp.git
cd grubhub-mcp
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grubhub": {
      "command": "/path/to/grubhub-mcp/.venv/bin/grubhub"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage with Other MCP Clients

Run the server over stdio:

```bash
# With uvx (no install needed)
uvx --from grubhub-mcp grubhub

# Or from a local install
grubhub

# Or as a Python module
python -m grubhub_mcp
```

## Authentication

**No login required** for browsing — search restaurants, view menus, and check prices without an account. The server automatically creates an anonymous session.

**Login required** for ordering, account management, and order history:

```
Use the login tool with my email and password
```

Supports email/password login and OTP (one-time passcode) authentication.

Sessions are stored in `~/.grubhub-mcp/session.json` (override the directory with
`GRUBHUB_SESSION_DIR`). Access tokens are refreshed on use, including before
expiry when Grubhub supplies expiry metadata and once after an authenticated
request returns 401. Rotated tokens are saved for the next server invocation.
Refresh responses that omit account metadata do not erase your login identity.
Concurrent refreshes are serialized within the client, and on POSIX systems
across server processes sharing the session directory. Session writes are atomic
and use private file permissions. Grubhub's lifetime fields are in minutes;
the observed access/refresh lifetimes are one hour / 30 days, but server policy
may change.
There is no background keep-alive: a revoked or expired refresh token still
requires a new login. Do not share your session file; it contains credentials.

## Order History Pagination

`get_order_history` uses server-side pagination so older orders are reachable.
`page_num` is **1-based** (default `1`), and `page_size` defaults to `20`.
Iterate from `1` through `pagination.total_pages` to retrieve the full history.
Both values must be positive. Order-detail and reorder fallbacks search across
all available history pages.

**Migration from v1.1.6:** callers using the old 0-based `page_num` must add one
to their page index. The response now provides `total_pages` and `current_page`
instead of the legacy `total_orders` value, which only counted a capped subset.

## How It Works

The API endpoints were reverse-engineered from the Grubhub Android app (v2026.11.1) by decompiling the APK with jadx and analyzing the Retrofit service interfaces, OkHttp interceptors, and data models.

Key technical details:
- **Base API**: `https://api-gtm.grubhub.com`
- **Auth**: Bearer token via email/password or anonymous sessions
- **Transport**: REST/JSON for most endpoints, Protobuf for some BFF services
- **Headers**: Mimics the Android app's request headers including `x-gh-browser-id`

## Development

Run the regression suite with:

```
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI runs tests on pushes and pull requests, and the release job runs them before
publishing. The package currently requires MCP 1.x (`mcp<2`).
